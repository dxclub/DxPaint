<!-- Dx Club Meeting, March 3rd, 2021.
    The code found in this project was created for the 
    routine coding challenge approached at during the
    first ten minutes of the meeting.

    For this meeting, we decided we'd destress a little and have
    a little paint night where we can express to everyone else in the club,
    just what Technology means to us.

    The code was worked on by Laura C., Diego G., and Salvador G. over the course of 3
    days. We have tried our best to reference all of the code that we have borrowed,
    and unless specified, all code was written by the 3 programmers listed above.

<!-- Diego here: I found this cool template for an HTML file and decided it would be a cool
addition to what we were already working on. The HTML is a free template and can be found
at https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_streetart&stacked=h
where you can download it and play with it too!
