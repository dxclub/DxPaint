# DxPaint
Okay! So this Project was to create something a little less CyberSecurity related and something a bit more fun/relazing.
Given that it's week 9, we wanted to create something that would help to calm tensions.
The project is dubbed DxPaint and it is a simple recreation of MS Paint written in JavaScript using the p5.js library.
All code was written by the Programmers: Laura C., Diego G., and Salvador G. unless otherwise specified.

The meeting takes/took place on March 3rd 2021 at 6pm PST.
